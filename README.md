# XrmWebTools for Dynamics 365 CRM

Welcome to **XrmWebTools**!

This Chrome extension started as Audit Engine 365 which was more a Proof Of Concept to showcase 1 WEB version of a single XTB tool.
Eventually more and more XTB tools will we available as a WEB version in XrmWebTools, so i want to make that clear from the beginning

## Features

- **Audits Today**
- **Audit Advanced Find**
- **Audit Center** 
- **Plugin Trace viewer**
- **Plugin Trace viewer** (still a WIP)
- **Users Last Login**
- **Load Online Users**

  (If you are the author of 1 of above tools in XTB and you don't want it to be shown as a WEB version, or you want to have some credit by adding your name or link to the XTB version, contact me and i'll change it.)
